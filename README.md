# Readme Generator

## Description

“Readme Generator” is a node application that creates and automatically formats a custom Readme.md file based on the user’s specification. Some categories, like testing and credits, are able to be skipped by the user entirely. The Readme Generator will save the user time when they finish their project as they won’t have to go through the arduous process of creating, formatting, and filling out an entire Readme file -- they’ll simply answer a few questions, instead.

## Installation

Simply open an integrated terminal within the Develop folder and run "node index.js".

## Usage

After the necessary dependencies are installed, answer each subsequent question by typing your response in the terminal window. Once you are finished typing, press the enter key to continue through the list of questions. You’ll know you’ve answered all of the questions when your terminal logs the message: “Your Readme.MD file has been successfully generated”. Finally, find the newly generated Readme.md file in the Development folder. If you wish to generate another Readme from scratch, delete the previous version before running the application a second time.
